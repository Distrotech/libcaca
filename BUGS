Video rendering

   o  ncurses' hashmap scrolling optimisation code causes the screen to
      occasionally flicker because it tries to optimise the vertical
      scrolling. With S-Lang, SLtt_Term_Cannot_Scroll prevents this
      unwanted behaviour.

   o  some terminal emulators (Konsole, or the Linux VGA console) honour
      the blink attribute instead of using it for bold or bright like any
      other terminal emulator, hence reducing the amount of available
      colour pairs.
