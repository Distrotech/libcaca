 cacaview is a simple image viewer for the terminal. It opens most image
 formats such as JPEG, PNG, GIF etc. and renders them on the terminal using
 ASCII art. The user can zoom and scroll the image, set the dithering method
 or enable anti-aliasing.
 .
 cacaball is a tiny graphic program that renders animated ASCII metaballs on
 the screen, cacafire is a port of AALib's aafire and displays burning ASCII
 art flames, cacamoir animates colourful moire circles and cacaplas displays
 an old school plasma effect.
