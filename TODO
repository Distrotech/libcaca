libcucul
========

  API-dependent stuff
  -------------------

   o brightness, contrast support for bitmaps

   o allow to select the characters that will be used for bitmap
     rendering, for instance halftoning (░ ▒ ▓ █) and quarter
     blocks (▀ ▄ ▌ ▐ █ ▖ ▗ ▘ ▝ ▚ ▞ ▙ ▛ ▜ ▟).

   o all the sprite stuff (loading, saving, blitting, transparency
     support, background colour support, thinking of a storage format,
     etc.)

   o bitmap output support (will require one or several custom fonts),
     maybe should be in libcaca.

   o support for more than 16 colours, maybe truecolor, maybe less

   o support for transparency (CUCUL_COLOR_TRANSPARENT)

   o ASCII/ANSI art loading functions (maybe load them as sprites)


  API-independent stuff
  ---------------------

   o Fix the thin ellipse rendering (currently it's only |s and -s, we
     could make them smoother by using ' ` , etc.

   o support for double width glyphs (also needs some libcaca changes)

   o better mask support in cucul_blit()


libcaca
=======

  API-dependent stuff
  -------------------

   o text edit widget with cursor support (I'm unsure about this, it
     seems pretty difficult)


  API-independent stuff
  ---------------------

   o Write a Linux console output

   o Better keyboard driver in an X terminal, see
     http://groups.yahoo.com/group/zepp/message/381

   o Unicode support for X11 (maybe through Xft)

   o fix Unicode support for ncurses

   o Unicode support for GL

   o and Jylam wants a framebuffer output


Language bindings
=================

  Needed
  ------

   o Fix Python

   o Fix Perl

   o C++ (given how object-oriented we now are, it will be a walk in the
     park)

   o C# (it's the next big thing, believe me)

   o PHP (together with the HTML output it would allow for nice web
     applications)

   o maybe Ruby, maybe Java


  Not that important
  ------------------

   o Ruby

   o Java


Kernel mode
===========

   o keyboard support

   o printf/fprintf are missing

   o Improve malloc/free so that we can reuse freed memory


Documentation
=============

   o Write a tutorial.

   o Draw a nicer logo


Applications
============

  cacaview
  --------

   o File browser

   o open ANSI files

   o save in different formats


  cacadraw
  --------

   o Does not exist yet, but I want it. A modern ANSI editor that can also
     do Unicode.


  CUCUlet
  -------

   o Does not exist yet, but I want it. A replacement for FIGlet that can
     also do Unicode

   o Colour support, of course: outputs to IRC, ANSI, HTML...

   o Open FIGlet fonts
