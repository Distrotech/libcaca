   o  Colour does not work with all backends and all terminals. I tested
      many terminal emulators and tried to summarise which combinations
      worked properly and which ones did not.

   o  In an XTerm terminal, the following shell commands output all possible
      foreground/background combinations:

      for fgpre in "" '\e[0;1m'; do for fg in 0 4 2 6 1 5 3 7; do
        for bgpre in 4 10; do
          echo -ne "$fgpre"'\e[3'$fg'm'
          for bg in 0 4 2 6 1 5 3 7; do echo -ne '\e['$bgpre$bg'm# '; done
          echo -ne '\e[0;0m '
        done
        echo ''
      done; echo ''; done

      Successfully tested

   o  ncurses:

      * bright combinations work in the following terminals:

        - Linux console (TERM=linux)
        - pterm (TERM=xterm)

      * bright text on bright background is rendered as bright text on
        normal background in the following terminals:

        - xterm (TERM=xterm)
        - gnome-terminal (TERM=xterm)

   o  S-Lang:

   o  MS-DOS: all bright colours, bright backgrounds, and bright combinations
      work using <conio.h>.
